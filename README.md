# MyProject
remade

I made a spider AI using the blueprint from SAICharacter (like we did with the ranged  minion) and a melee attack
task subclass. The spider will chase the player and attack it with the melee attack parameters, dealing damage to the player.
It can be killed/otherwise functions similarly to the minion. 

I do have a persisting issue with the AI animations that I ran out of time to fix. :|
